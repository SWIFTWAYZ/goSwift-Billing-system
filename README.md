This is where post-trip processing happens. Billing of trip based on trip data
received from dispatch through message broker is carried out by Billing system. Rate

or fare estimates are done by this module. This module gives users ability to configure base rates, 
rates per kilometer, rates per minute, cancellation fee, time-windows, fare estimate for car-pooling, 
fare splitting for car-pools using a web application. Support user profiles for drivers, partners and administrators.
